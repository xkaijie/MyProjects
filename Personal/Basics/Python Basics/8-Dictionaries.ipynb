In a list one keeps track of the elements by an index that must be an integer.  **Dictionaries keep track of elements by `key`!**\n","\n","Each element in a dictionary is an **item**, and every `item` has both a **key** and a **value**. You use the `key` to \"look up\" the `value`. This concept is just like if we wanted to look up the meaning of a word in a real dictionary. Also, just like in a real dictionary, it means that all of the `keys` **must** be unique. If we had a `key` multiple times, then we wouldn't know where to go look up its `value`. Remember `sets`?  **The `keys` in a dictionary form a set!**\n","\n","The syntax to create a dictionary also uses the syntax`{}`. If we are initializing a dictionary, we enter `key-value` pairs separated by commas; for each `item`, the key is separated from the value by a colon.\n","\n","`a_dict = {key : value, another_key : another_value}`\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ehKKdFYdLXFB","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## What are dictionaries good for?\n","\n","Great that you would ask!

Dictionaries are **mutable**. You can change the value of an element by re-assigning its value.\n","\n","Dictionaries are **unordered**. If you print the same dictionary twice, the order in which `items` will be printed does not need to be the same. \n","\n","If we want to add a new `key-value` pair to the dictionary, we access a new `key` and assign it a value. If we want to add multiple `items` to a dictionary, we must use the built-in method `update()`."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"qKyMP7UXLXFZ","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":35},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1590818741679,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":1232,"user":{"displayName":"Desmond Sek","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GjQj9ANFvLsRLkJAoNiRe9I6br32aYvAs1rqTwiF6M=s64","userId":"15004601375355093954"}},"outputId":"825b84ce-57e1-4055-cbfc-c69c935ae80c"},"source":["# Let us create a dictionary\n","data_dict = {} #a blank dictionary\n","\n","data_dict['Favorite Sport'] = 'Soccer'# 'Favorite Sport' is our `Key`, 'Soccer' is the `value`\n","print(data_dict)\n","#print(len(data_dict))"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["{'Favorite Sport': 'Soccer'}\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"9GtauZxrbGxl","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":35},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1590818789334,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":1469,"user":{"displayName":"Desmond Sek","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GjQj9ANFvLsRLkJAoNiRe9I6br32aYvAs1rqTwiF6M=s64","userId":"15004601375355093954"}},"outputId":"305ccad5-fe83-4417-9502-f58cd3705a3e"},"source":["data_dict.update({'Favorite Sports Team': 'S.
