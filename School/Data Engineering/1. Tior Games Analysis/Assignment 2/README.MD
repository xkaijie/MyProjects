Section 1 Shadow systems and trends
You are given this spreadsheet that maps a departmental system that the storage manager and employees are using to store data and information about merchandise and providers in Europe, as the employees find the global Tior Gaming native system over complicated and not fit for purpose. 

During your presentation:
Take 2-3 minutes to discuss any problems that can arise in the data warehouse from the extensive use of these shadow data, in relation to the line of business and accuracy.
Visualisation section:
Create and present 2 visualisations merging the excel spreadsheet with the existing data from the data warehouse.
Create and present 2 identical to question a (previous question) visualisations using ONLY the existing data from the data warehouse.
Discuss: 
Differences in trends, outliers and seasonality between the visualisations in questions a and b above. 
How would the introduction of the data from the spreadsheet in the data warehouse potentially affect the business plans and decisions? 
Make sure a reader can easily identify and see the trends, outliers and seasonality in the type of visualisations you select!

Section 2 Forecasting
In every presentation a good story needs to end with either some cheerful note or a prediction for the future. Given the fact that you present to the board of directors, your DBA suggests that you take the 3-5 final minutes in the presentation and discuss future gaming trends in the finance market. 

For this part you must create a storyboard with two visualisations.

You must include data from the Tior Gaming data warehouse AND external data. Feel free to use any external sources, which need to be referenced. You are given full freedom to blend or not the two data sources.

Both visualisations must predict something useful and reasonable for the future and for that  you must use the forecasting Tableau tools. You are given full freedom as to what. Some suggestions may include, but are not limited to: PC vs console gaming sales, gaming sales trends, user experience based on different factors, popularity of a game during covid19 etc.

You must use Tableau to create your visualisations.
You can create more than 2 visualizations, but they will not get extra marks. I will always mark the first 2.
